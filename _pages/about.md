Education
======
* Ph.D. in Statistics and Neural Computation, Carnegie Mellon University, 
Jan 2020 - (exp) Dec 2024
* B.S. in Physics, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), 2014 - 2018

Qualification
======
* 5+ Years research experience in statistics, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.
* 5+ Years of programming experience, familiar with Python (PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook), MATLAB, R, LaTeX.

Research Experience
======
My research lies in time series analysis with special focus on point processes and their applications in neuroscience. 

*Detecting interactions between multiple groups of point processes in brain data*  
Mar 2022 – Present  
Advisor: Prof. Robert E. Kass  
* Designed a robust and efficient generative model to detect interactions between groups of point processes.
* Achieved higher statistical power while reducing quadratic complexity to linear complexity, by pooling point processes and introducing non-linear self-modulating effects.
* The inferred graph of communication between mouse visual areas reveals new cross-area interactions undiscovered.

*Neural activity reconstruction from multi-electrode local field potential recording*  
Jan 2021 – Oct 2021  
Advisor: Prof. Robert E. Kass  
* Created a current source reconstruction method based on regularized regression, which outperforms current methods with higher accuracy and fewer artifacts.
* Developed an optimization algorithm which efficiently handles highly correlated predictors with multiple regularization terms including L1 penalty.

*Modeling the locomotion decision-making network of C. elegans*  
Apr 2017 – Jun 2019  
Advisor: Prof. Quan Wen  
* Built a biological neural network model that explains and reproduces the behavioral statistics of C. elegans (roundworm) escape response. The model correctly predicted results of other experiments, including optogenetic and calcium imaging.
* Trained a recurrent spiking network to perform escape response with evolutionary algorithm, which matches the proposed model undesignedly.

*Theoretical study on point process generalized linear models*  
Dec 2019 – Dec 2020  
Advisor: Prof. Robert Kass  
* Proved orthogonality of the history effect to stimulus effect in point process generalized linear models of spiking neurons.
* Developed an algorithm that estimates coupling effects twenty times more efficiently than traditional approaches.
Fixing the inherent instability problem in empirical spiking neuron model   Jul 2017 – Sep 2017
Advisor: Prof. Robert Kass
* Explored causes and proposed solutions for the instability problem: fitted point process regression models pass the goodness-of-fit test but generate simulated spike trains with explosive firing rates.
* Created an outlier detection method and a lack-of-data diagnosis to avoid instability.


Selected Course Project
======
*Image caption generation with Transformer-Transformer architecture*  
Fall 2021  
Course: 10-701 Introduction to Machine Learning  
* We implemented a Transformer-Transformer architecture image captioning model, with pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) as the encoder and GPT-2 as the decoder. After fine-tuning, our model outperforms the CNN-LSTM baseline. We further improved the performance by data augmentation. See our final report here.
